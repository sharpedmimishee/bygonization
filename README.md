# Bygonization
A video editor plugin powered.
## Features (included plans)
- plugin support
The Bygonization planned separating features as some plugins to avoid enlargement of basic features.
## For developers of plugins
Thank you for thinking to develop a plugin or Bygonization/Bygonizer.  
You ought to see this source code if you don't know this mechanism.  
Back ends are called as Bygonizer and written in Rust.  

> [!Caution]
> Long compilation time irritates developers(Especially me), but this software takes a long time to compile because of using large libraries/crates and ugly codes.
> Therefore, there is a possibility that libraries/crates would be changed.
